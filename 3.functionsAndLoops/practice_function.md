## 1. Basic Function Declaration:

[ ] Write a function called greet that takes a name as a parameter and returns a greeting message. For example, calling greet('John') should return 'Hello, John!'.

## 2. Function with Default Parameter:

[ ] Create a function named calculateArea that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle. The function should take two parameters, length and width, with a default value of 1 for both.

## 3. Function with Multiple Parameters:

[ ] Write a function called calculateTotal that takes three parameters: price, quantity, and taxRate. It should return the total cost, including tax.

## 4. Function with Callback:

[ ] Create a function named performOperation that takes two numbers and a callback function as parameters. The callback function should perform a specific mathematical operation (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, divide) on the two numbers. Test it with different operations.

## 5. Function Scope:

[ ] Write a function named outerFunction that declares a variable. Inside outerFunction, define an inner function called innerFunction that tries to access the variable declared in the outer function. Call innerFunction and observe the result. Explain the result.
